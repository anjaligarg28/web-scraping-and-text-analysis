# web-scraping-and-text-analysis
scraping web pages to extract the required data using html parser, then perform text analysis on the extracted data.

This project is to demonstrate how you can extract data from a website url in python.
The data was then stored in txt files.
I used 100+ links to extract their text data and analyse it to check its sentiment and what is it about.

The final analysed sheet contained the following metrics:
URL,	Positive Score,	Negative Score,	Polarity Score,	Subjectivity Score,	Avg Sentence Length,	Avg No of Words per Sentence,	Avg Word Length,	Personal Pronoun Count,	Word Count,	Average Syllable Count,	Complex Word Count,	Percentage of Complex Words,Fog Index
